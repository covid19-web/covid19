                    The first idea is that in the presence of Rapid tests - (the main rapid tests to determine the presence of immunoglobulins in the blood and available in Europe today), it is possible to carry out monitoring - research among a certain number of citizens
                    wishing to detect specific antibodies, for example in the Lviv region. In addition, there will be one condition for those wishing to take the test - to answer in the questionnaire three questions: was / were vaccinated against influenza,
                    tuberculosis, and whether they were ill with influenza / tuberculosis this year. Additionally, a person should indicate which blood group they have. Compared to other regions or countries (just in Europe such testing is being done,
                    we have not yet) and it will probably reveal the causes of different incidence of COVID 19 in different countries. The information about health and seek persons in Lviv region, Western Ukraine and Belarus will be collected and processed.
                    In addition, the open source information about other CEI countries will be processed. The second idea is to create the software application that will allow you to analyze the information received on major social networks (Twitter,
                    Facebook, etc.) and compare it with information from official websites of the MoH or WHO. This will make it possible to objectify the real situation with COVID 19 and reduce panic among the population and develop covinophobia. For
                    example, on the social network, certain information is published about the number of patients, or about the death rate, or other COVID-related information. The program seeks confirmation of this information by key phrases, dates, etc.
                    on the main and official sites of medicine and WHO and the Ministry of Health and others. In its absence, the denial of the fake is immediately published. This will significantly reduce panic among the population and make people only
                    use truthful information. The results of implementation of this idea allow education operators and health operators to increase theirs professional output and find the sources of fake news.
